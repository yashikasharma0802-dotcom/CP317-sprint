## Set up Instructions:
Follow the instructions below to download, open, and run the project locally. This project was created using static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so npm, databases, and any external databases or systems are not required.

#### System Requirements to run:
* Visual Studio Code
* Liver Sever Extension
* Any modern web browser (Chrome, Safari, Brave, Firefox, etc.)
* _No npm install backend or database needed_

#### Step 1: Clone the GitHub Repository
Make sure that Git is installed on your device.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jayden-graneta/HawkShop-Redesign.git
cd HawkShop-Redesign
```
Alternatively, the GitHub Repo can also be downloaded from the Zip file and extracted into your computer!

#### Step 2: Opening project in VS Code
* Launch **Visual Studio Code** Application.
* Click **File -> Open Folder.**
* Select the project's root directory (HawkShop-Redesign/homepage/)
* Wait for the workspace to load.

#### Step 3: Install Live Server
This project uses an extension called Live Server, which allows developers to see Live changes to Code on their preferred browser.
* Open the Extension panel in VS Code.
* Search for Live Server.
* Download Live Server by Ritwick Dey.
* Reload VS Code to apply the new extension.

#### Step 4: Run the Project:
* In **VS Code's** File Explorer, find **index.html**.
* Right-click on the file.
* Select **Open with Live Server**.
* Your Browser will then open at a URL like:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:5500/

or

http://localhost:5500/

```
* __Any changes that you make to the HTML, JavaScript or CSS will instantly show up in the reloaded browser!__

### Troubleshooting
* Live Server not working
  - Restart VS Code.
  - Reinstall Live Server Extension.
  - Try launching from a different HTML file.
* Page not loading
  - Confirm that you started the site with Live Server, not just opening the file directly.
  - Make sure that VS Code stays open.
  - Check that the file paths inside HTML are correctly downloaded
* CSS or JS not loading:
  - Try refreshing the browser using Ctrl + Shift + R
